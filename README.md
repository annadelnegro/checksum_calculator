Checksum Calculator

A program that calculates the checksum for the text in a file

Assignment: pa02 - Calculating an 8, 16, or 32 bit checksum on an ASCII input file

Author: Anna Del Negro

School: University of Central Florida

Language: c, c++, Java, go, python

To Compile: javac pa01.java || gcc -o pa01 pa01.c || g++ -o pa01 pa01.cpp || go build pa01.go

To Execute: java -> java pa02 inputFile.txt 8 || c++ -> ./pa02 inputFile.txt 8 || c -> ./pa02 inputFile.txt 8 || go -> ./pa02 inputFile.txt 8 || python -> ppython pa02.py inputFile.txt 8

When: inputFile.txt is an ASCII input file and the number 8 could also be 16 or 32 which are the valid checksum sizes, all other values are rejected with an error message and program termination

Note: All input files are simple 8 bit ASCII input
